Name: Path tracer

Controls:
Works with both keyboard and the xbox controller, however prefer using the controller as
the car handles better and the powerups may have some issues with keyboard controls.
Xbox controller:
Right stick- controls car direction
Right trigger- is gas
Left trigger- is brake
B button- hand brake (not very good at the moment just a weaker brake)
A button- use powerup
Y button- throw powerup away
Back button- reset the game
Keyboard:

Currently included Features:
Game rules (path generating and health for following car which is lost when not on the path)
Powerups (simple powerups none of the complicated ones yet)
Car driving physics (better with the controller though more range of motion with the 
			keyboard which leads to some problems with control though)
Sound (at the moment temp sound track and car driving sound)
Split screen 2 player
Ai for both front and back state of the car

Still required:
Complex powerups or better powerup system
Game states from a start menu to a lose screen
Other sound effects

Wish list:
