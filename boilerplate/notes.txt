Px in physics is for physx 
pvd is for linking to additional library
simulate(1.f , 60.f) is a function to simulate scene with parameters specifying fps
body->attacheshape
PxTransform transform = groundPlane->getGlobalPose(); returns a PxTransform object (px Vec3 translation in world space and quaternion for rotation)
PxVec3 ps = transform.parameters();
PxVec3 Rx = transform.q.getBasisVector0(); x vec for transform matrix
PxVec3 Ry = transform.q.getBasisVector1(); y vec for transform matrix
PxVec3 Rz = transform.q.getBasisVector2(); z vec for transform matrix

Quick Descriptions:

Damping: Resistance. An opposing force. Damping coefficient must be greater than 0
	LinearDamping: resistance when moving forward
	AngularDamping: resistance when turning
Velocity: speed. Velocity is modified in accordance to gravity
	LinearVelocity: straight forward
	AngularVelocity: rate of change of angular displacement
Torque: rotation on an axis
Static friction: the amount of friction that is applied between surfaces that are not moving lateral to each-other
Dynamic friction: the amount of friction applied between surfaces that are moving relative to each-other
(Coefficient of) Restitution: speed after collision/speed before collision
	-when restitution = 1, collide elastically. No change in kinetic energy after a collision.
	-when restitution < 1, inelastic
Mass Properties
Density: used to compute the mass of the body (in PxRigidBodyExt::updateMassAndInertia). Must be greater than 0.
